### Adding a New Static Site Generator

If you're adding a new static site generator to the list, please ensure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format in the appropriate section:
  - For tables: `| [Name](link) | ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/user/repo) | Language | Templates | Description |`
  - For bullet points: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- Place your entry in the appropriate category (by type or language).
- If the generator doesn't fit in any existing category, you may suggest a new one.
- Provide a brief description that clearly explains what makes this generator unique.
- Check that the GitHub stars shield is correct.
- Ensure links point to the generator's main page or GitHub repository.

### Updating Existing Information

When updating information about a generator:

- Verify that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
- Maintain the existing format and style.
- If updating GitHub stats, ensure they reflect the current numbers.
- If updating a description, make sure it remains concise and informative.

### Updating the README Structure

If you're proposing changes to the README structure:

- Ensure the new structure improves organization and discoverability.
- Update the table of contents to reflect your changes.
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document.
- Consider how your changes affect the overall user experience.

## 💻 Technical Guidelines 💻

- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe your changes.
- Ensure pull request titles are concise and descriptive.

## 🔄 Updating your Pull Request 🔄

Sometimes, a maintainer might ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the guidelines.
